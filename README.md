# Quiz-Game

A Front-End Web Development beginner friendly project based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript. There will be appear 10 questions & you have to answer 10 questions. We can say it is just a quiz game. Based on your right and wrong answer you will get your score at the end of the quiz. You can add more questions in the JavaScript Sections. I did this project for the TechnoHacks Edutech Officials Internship.
